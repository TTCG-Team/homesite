<ul>
<li>On 25 October 2010, former Prime Minister John Howard had a pair of shoes thrown at him from a member of the audience due to responses on his attitude to the Iraq War. The shoe-thrower was subsequently removed from the audience. Although Howard seemed indifferent to the incident, it was criticised by both Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott, among other members of Parliament from both the Government and the Opposition. The shoe-thrower, environmental activist Peter Gray, died of cancer six months later; before he died, however, he asked the ABC to auction his shoes and the money to be donated to the Red Cross.[18][19][20] Tony Jones announced the auction on the show on 9 May 2011, saying: “Before he died he asked that the shoes, which we kept, be auctioned for charity and the money given to the International Committee for the Red Cross for its work in Iraq. Former Prime Minister John Howard has expressed sorrow at Mr Gray’s death and endorsed this idea. So the shoes, which symbolise the [sic] their disagreement over Iraq, will now be used to provide practical help to people in Iraq.”[21] The auction was won by Volley for $3,650.[22]</li>

<h2 id="university-student-protest">University student protest</h2>
<ul>
<li>The show was disrupted on 5 May 2014, when a group of university students began protesting against proposed higher education cuts. The group unfurled a banner over the back of the set and began to chant at Minister for Education Christopher Pyne, before they were removed from the studio while the live broadcast was replaced with footage of a musical performance from an earlier episode. In the lead-up to the protest, Pyne was the subject of several questions regarding education cuts and was heckled by members of the Socialist Alternative.[23]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="zaky-mallah-incident">Zaky Mallah incident</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Zaky Mallah incident stirred great controversy and led to a boycott of Q+A by the Abbott government, after a former terror suspect was invited to ask a question of a minister from the live audience.[24] Zaky Mallah had been convicted of threatening to kill Commonwealth officials in 2003,[25][26] but found not guilty of terrorism offences in 2005.[27] Prior to his appearance on the program, Mallah had tweeted derogatorily and lewdly about two female News Ltd columnists, Miranda Devine and Rita Panahi, mentioning gang banging them.[28][29] He was known to Q+A’s editorial team, attending three shows as an audience member since 2011, and twice being rejected as a panel member,[30][31][32] but they were not aware of the misogynist tweets; Jones said that he would not have been allowed on the programme had they known.[29]</li>
<li>On 22 June 2015, Mallah posed a pre-approved question about terrorism laws to Parliamentary secretary Steven Ciobo, who was on the Q+A panel that night: “What would have happened if my [terrorism] case had been decided by the Minister and not the courts?” and confirmed he had pleaded guilty to threatening to kill officials.[33] Ciobo replied that he understood that the acquittal was based on a technicality, so would be happy to see the government remove Mallah from the country.[34] Mallah later was directed to respond, saying “The Liberals now have just justified to many Australian Muslims in the community tonight to leave and go to Syria and join ISIS because of ministers like him”. Jones called these comments “totally out of order”.[33] Mallah later wrote that he “hates ISIS” and his comments were “misinterpreted”.[35]</li>
<li>The following day, the ABC published an apology for including Mallah on a live event, admitting to an error of judgement,[36] and around a week later the ABC board appointed Shaun Brown and Ray Martin to do an independent audit of the show,[37] and issued a formal warning to Q+A executive producer Peter McEvoy.[38] ABC director Mark Scott conceded the producers had erred putting Mallah on live television, but defended the independence of the ABC’s editorial decisions[39] and argued there is merit in platforming “views that run contrary to accepted public values” in order to “understand the root cause” of alarming actions.[40]</li>
<li>Following the incident, the ABC reported that it had received over 1000 complaints over its decision to allow Mallah into the audience.[41] The decision was criticised by Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek,[42] and Prime Minister Tony Abbott[43][44][45] banned members of his frontbench appearing on the program.[46] He later offered to permit them if the show was moved from the ABC’s Television section to News and Current Affairs.[47] Substantially negative coverage of the ABC’s conduct appeared in News Corporation-owned papers,[48][49] including The Daily Telegraph[50] and The Australian.[51] Other commentators defended the ABC, including Ray Martin,[52] Peter Greste,[53] Jonathan Holmes,[54] and Richard Ackland.[55]</li>
<li>In August 2015 the ABC moved the show from its entertainment division to the news division, which would subject it to more oversight and stricter guidelines.[4] In November 2015, Tony Jones said the furore and boycott was based on a “big lie” [that Mallah supported ISIS].[56]</li>

<h2 id="duncan-storrar">Duncan Storrar</h2>
<ul>
<li>Duncan Storrar asked assistant government minister Kelly O’Dwyer a question on tax-free thresholds, asking why poorer people were not receiving similar tax relief from the Coalition government. He quickly gained widespread support as an embodiment for the ‘battling Aussie’. The publicity from his question caused various media outlets to cover his life, with some outlets publishing allegations that he was a drug addict and that he had previously failed to care for his family. Storrar became traumatised as a result of his harsh media treatment.[57][58] A crowdfunding campaign was started to buy him a new toaster, which played on O’Dwyer’s remarks about depreciation treatment for small business, namely cafes.[59]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yassmin-abdel-magied">Yassmin Abdel-Magied</h2>
<ul>
<li>In February 2017, panellist Yassmin Abdel-Magied defended sharia law, arguing that Islam is “the most feminist” of all religions.[60] On the same program, Abdel-Magied stated in response to another panellist, Jacqui Lambie, that Sharia law is as simple as “me praying five times day,” and that it says in Islam, “you follow the law of the land on which you are on”.[60] Some Islamic scholars[who?] have disputed this saying “they must comply with the laws of their country of residence without, at the same time, disobeying Islamic law.”[61]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="qa-broadside">Q+A Broadside</h2>
<ul>
<li>On 4 November 2019, Q+A hosted a special show in conjunction with The Wheeler Centre’s Broadside festival of feminist ideas.[62] The show aired content including swearing and discussions about violence. This led to hundreds of complaints being filed against the ABC about language and viewpoints,[63] resulting in the ABC network opening an investigation into whether the show violated editorial standards. Panellists included Mona Eltahawy; author Jess Hill; Nayuka Gorrie; Ashton Applewhite; Hana Assafiri; and host, Fran Kelly.[citation needed]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2022-russian-invasion-of-ukraine">2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On 3 March 2022, Q+A fielded several questions on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by Russia. A Russian-Australian audience member, Sasha Gillies-Lekakis, saying that there were a lot of Russians both in Australia and around the world who support Putin’s actions, and accusing the Ukrainian Government of collaborating with “Nazi groups like the Azov Battalion in “besieg[ing] the Russian populations in the Donbas, killing an estimated 13,000 people”, asked the panel why grief and concern had not been expressed for those Russians. Host Stan Grant pointed out that the UN had recorded 13,000 deaths in total (both sides) since the conflict began in 2014.[64][65] Some time later, after other questions and discussions, Grant asked that Gillies-Lekakis leave the studio.[64] Grant apologised for not having ejected him directly after his question, saying “We can’t have people advocating violence, and I should have asked you to leave”. After an argument with another audience member, the questioner was ejected from the studio by security.[66][67]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ABC posted an explanation of the incident afterwards on the Q+A website:[64]</p>
<p>Sasha Gillies-Lekakis did not ask the question that he had agreed[a] and what he said instead contained major inaccuracies. He was asked to finish his question and the issue was aired in the panel discussion. As the program developed, Stan Grant, a highly experienced presenter of live TV, was aware that other audience members were distressed. After careful consideration he decided the best course of action was for Mr Gillies-Lekakis to leave the studio, which was live-to-air. The ABC fully supports his judgement and handling of this situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discussion of the incident followed in the media, with commentators agreeing that Gillies-Lukakis deserved a strong rebuttal for “promoting Russian propaganda”, but that sending him out gave the appearance of “weakness rather than the moral and intellectual strength these times demand”.[69][70][71]</p>
